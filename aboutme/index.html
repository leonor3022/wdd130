    <p>Hello everyone. Nice meeting you all. I am a married twice. 
    I got three children with my first husband. After 16 years of being 
    a widow, I met my second husband who is a member of the church. 
    I and my oldest son became a member of the church 3 years ago. 
    My second husband has 3 children and 2 grandchildren. They are all 
    active in the church. During my free time, I love to sing songs and 
    go to beaches to unwind.</p>
    <p>I am from Davao City, Philippines and my husband is from Pasig
    City, Philippines. Currently, I and my husband are in Orlando Florida 
    because I got a teaching job at Orange County District. I am teaching
    mathematics for high school students. My husband and I were here since
    August of last year. All our children are older than 18 and we were not 
    able to bring them here. All of them together with our grandchildren are 
    in the Philippines.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing with Software Development degree because I know I would
    not love teaching when I get old. I want to switch profession where I 
    would only work with myself and the computer. I believe that as a mathematics
    teacher, I would be successful in this degree. Since, my husband and I 
    are Senior Service Missionary, who are giving advice to our students in 
    PathwayConnect to matriculate, I am motivated to enroll at BYUI. I prefer
    BYUI since education is somewhat affordable, there is a scholarship and I 
    can earn another in demand profession online.</p>
    <p>As a new member of the church I love to listen to the talks of the leaders. 
    I like all their talks, maybe my favorite is on education that "For members
    of the church, education is not merely a good idea-it's a commandment" 
    according to President Dieter F. Uchtdorf. I love our Heavenly Father 
    and I am happy I became a member of the church.</p>
